# BulkRegister

This application was created with the intention of learning more about C# and the WPF framework. 

I wanted to mess with a private Habbo server just to prove them I was able to create a lot of accounts in a short space of time (even though they said I couldn't). I ended up adding a few Quality of Life features to it and have a lot of fun in the process.

## Getting Started

To run this app on your computer all you have to do is download the source, run the Visual Studio Solution file and compile the projects.

### Prerequisites

I used a few libraries in order to accomplish some tasks. Make sure you have all of them installed (even though they are referenced in the packages and should be downloaded by Visual Studio automatically).

## Functionality 

This application is strictly focused on generating login details and registering those accounts in the server.
